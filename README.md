# Illustrating Python via Bioinformatics
 Life is definitely digital. 
 The genetic code of all living organisms are represented by a long sequence of simple molecules called nucleotides, or bases, which makes up the Deoxyribonucleic acid, better known as DNA. 
 There are only four such nucleotides, and the entire genetic code of a human can be seen as a simple, though 3 billion long, string of the letters A, C, G, and T. Analyzing DNA data to gain increased biological understanding is much about searching in (long) strings for certain string patterns involving the letters A, C, G, and T. 
 This is an integral part of bioinformatics, a scientific discipline addressing the use of computers to search for, explore, and use information about genes, nucleic acids, and proteins.
